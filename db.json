      "bio": "Dr. Gilmer was a leader in the field of Ethnomathematics, the study of how different people, in different cultures, use mathematics. The term was coined by Brazilian mathematician Ubiratan D’Ambrosio in 1977. Dr. Gilmer was a co-founder of the International Study Group on Ethnomathematics (ISGEm) in 1985, along with D’Ambrosio, Gil Cuevas and Rick Scott. She was the first president of the organization and also served on the Executive Board. ISGEm strives to increase our understanding of the cultural diversity of mathematical practices. She was president of the organization for eleven years and remained on the board as Past president for many years. She is known for her paper on Using Technology to Explore Mathematical Patterns in African American Hairstyles, such as corn rows. She linked how these hair tessellations (patterns) were often similar to the patterns found in nature. She especially enjoyed showing her students that mathematics can be found in many unexpected places.",

People believed their mystical potions could cure body and soul and sometimes they could. Some modern medicines still use herbal derivatives.

After completing Part 1, I returned to London, where I joined the Textile Futures MA at Central Saint Martins. The course was really about thinking of materiality in the context of culture, craft, and technology. My research explored emerging fields of biotechnology, like synthetic biology, a discipline of science that places engineering principles to design biology using new tools and DNA. I was excited to discover what the engineering of biology meant for design. How could somebody design an organism? What and who is an organism designer? And under what auspices might they design an organism? When I graduated, I saw an opportunity to explore these ideas from a less theoretic basis, so I reached out to Professor John Ward, a synthetic biologist from University College London’s Department of Biochemical Engineering. I became a designer in residence in his laboratory and began to experiment with bacteria to try to grasp, through practice, how design could interact with synthetic biology and the natural world.",

In 1968, she began a “pig bank” to provide free pigs for Black farmers to breed, raise, and slaughter. A year later she launched the Freedom Farm Cooperative (FFC), buying up land that Blacks could own and farm collectively. With the assistance of donors (including famed singer Harry Belafonte), she purchased 640 acres and launched a coop store, boutique, and sewing enterprise. She single-handedly ensured that 200 units of low-income housing were built—many still exist in Ruleville today. The FFC lasted until the mid-1970s; at its heyday, it was among the largest employers in Sunflower County. Extensive travel and fundraising took Hamer away from the day-to-day operations, as did her failing health, and the FFC hobbled along until folding. Not long after, in 1977, Hamer died of breast cancer at age 59.",

There, she received hands-on experience conducting experiments. Her supervisor eventually suggested she enter a training program that would allow Jackson to earn a promotion from mathematician to engineer. Because the classes were held at then-segregated Hampton High School, Jackson needed special permission to join her white peers in the classroom. Jackson completed the courses, earned the promotion, and in 1958 became NASA's first African American female engineer. For nearly two decades during her engineering career, she authored or co-authored numerous research reports, most of which focused on the behavior of the boundary layer of air around airplanes. In 1979, she joined Langley's Federal Women's Program, where she worked hard to address the hiring and promotion of the next generation of female mathematicians, engineers, and scientists. She retired from Langley in 1985 and passed away in Hampton on February 11, 2005, at the age of 83.

You see, when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager, I loved designing and making doll clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer. I took art and ceramics. I loved dance: Lola Falana, Alvin Ailey, Jerome Robbins. And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs. I had science projects and tons of astronomy books. I took calculus and philosophy. I wondered about infinity and the Big Bang theory. And when I was at Stanford, I found myself, my senior year, chemical engineering major, half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major, which was sort of true, because I was Black Student Union President, and I did major in some other things. And I found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes, logic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and also producing and choreographing a dance production. And I had to do the lighting and the design work, and I was trying to figure out: Do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer, or to go to medical school? Now, my mother helped me figure that one out. But when I went into space, I carried a number of things up with me. I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey -- you can figure out now, I love the dance company -- an Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance \"Cry,\" dedicated to all black women everywhere; a Bundu statue, which was from the women's society in Sierra Leone; and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students to work to improve their science and math. And folks asked me, \"Why did you take up what you took up?\" And I had to say, \"Because it represents human creativity; the creativity that allowed us, that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle, which springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis that it took to carve a Bundu statue, or the ingenuity it took to design, choreograph and stage \"Cry.\" Each one of them are different manifestations, incarnations, of creativity -- avatars of human creativity.",

      "bio": "Born in 1861 into slaveholding Rutherford County, Callie Guy, later known as Callie House, was a pioneering African American political activist who campaigned for slave reparations in the burgeoning Jim Crow-era American South. However, Callie House and her organization faced opposition from both African American leaders and government officials. The passage of segregation laws throughout the South fostered this antagonistic climate. African American leaders such as Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois largely ignored the reparations movement, focusing their energy on promoting education and defending equal treatment for African Americans within a white supremacist culture. White southerners viewed the reparations movement with suspicion; they saw Callie House’s organizing efforts as confusing and misleading to African Americans. From the white perspective, there was no chance of Congress passing reparation legislation; so whites assumed that the organizing efforts of House and Dickerson were defrauding African Americans of their hard-earned money. Although the evidence was weak, an all-male, white jury convicted Callie House on the charge of mail fraud, resulting in a sentence of a year and one day. She served her sentence in the Jefferson City, Missouri, penitentiary from November 1917 to August 1, 1918, earning early release for good behavior. Following her release from prison, she resumed her work as a laundress in her local south Nashville community.",

      "bio": "This is the first night of the 150th anniversary celebration for the United Order of Tents, a secret society of black women. Annette Richter is the great-great-granddaughter of Annetta M. Lane, the enslaved woman who founded this order in 1867. I am not sure if you have ever been graciously but firmly pushed out of line by elegantly dressed black senior citizens, but I can tell you the experience is nothing short of affirming. \"Excuse me, dear.\" \"Darling, could I just?\" they say, and Annette is surrounded, and I realize my chance to talk with her will have to come another day. This is a moment that exemplifies the spirit of the Tents. It is an organization made up of dozens of chapters all over the South and Northeast, with hundreds of members currently. It was founded on the ideals of freedom, independence, and self-autonomy, but it is also firmly rooted in the practical. The Tents is a massively successful, wonderfully efficient community self-help organization that has operated without outside help for over 150 years. But because it is run by and for black women — black churchwomen — it is largely unknown and in fact was deliberately kept secret for much of its existence. Annetta M. Lane and Harriet R. Taylor, two black women from Virginia, founded this order in 1867. Annetta was enslaved in Virginia and, according to her family's history, was a nurse on her plantation. This role meant that she moved both among the white enslavers in the main house and among the black people the family enslaved in the fields. Such a role meant she was valuable to the white slavers, and it also meant she could transmit information and care to those enslaved. The sermon ends with this litany of prayer: \"Pray until domestic violence ends. Pray until there's liberty and justice for all. Pray until there is a cure for all cancers. Pray until racism ends. Pray until there is health care for the whole universe. Pray until we're all together as one.",

Leigh’s most famous work, a 2014 project called Free People’s Medical Clinic, started with a historical inquiry into the United Order of Tents, a secret society founded in 1867 by two former enslaved people that convenes Black women nurses and is still in operation. Organized by Creative Time, the project that grew out of it converted Brooklyn’s Stuyvesant Mansion into a functioning medical center that offered free HIV tests, health screenings, yoga, and more to the surrounding community. It paid homage to Josephine English, the first Black ob-gyn in Brooklyn, who once worked at Stuyvesant Mansion, and to community-oriented endeavors launched by the Black Panthers. (The Asiko Art School, which is operated by the Centre for Contemporary Art Lagos without any government funding, was also an influence.) Free People’s Medical Clinic helped put Leigh on the map, and it has endured as one of Leigh’s iconic works, even though it only exists now in the form of documentation. (The project is often classified as social practice, a kind of activist-oriented art reliant mainly on interactions, conversations, and exchanges instead of physical objects.) She later expanded on it for a project known as The Waiting Room (2016), and she has spoken about it as a form of health care that could be trusted by Black women, who have historically been disadvantaged by the current systems in the United States. While much of her other work takes vastly different forms, the concepts that guide the project infiltrate her other pieces. “The general lack of empathy for black people is a factor in every aspect of interaction with medical providers,” she told Art in America in 2015. “It goes to the core of what is difficult to name and change in terms of structural racism and sexism.” An event called 'Afrocentering with Aimee Meredith Cox' held as part of Simone Leigh's 2016 installation 'The Waiting Room' at the New Museum in New York.",

      "bio": "In three books and a series of essays, Hartman has explored the interior lives of enslaved people and their descendants, employing a method that she says “troubles the line between history and imagination.” Her iconoclastic thinking on the legacy of slavery in American life has prefigured the current cultural moment. In 2008, five years before Black Lives Matter was founded, she wrote of “a past that has yet to be done, and the ongoing state of emergency in which black life remains in peril.” Her writing has become a lodestar for a generation of students and, increasingly, for politically engaged people outside the academy. Hartman began thinking about the invisible framework that governed her (relatively charmed) life as a young Black woman. “I wanted to understand the inequality that was structuring the world—even as I was feeling that it had not made anything impossible for me,” she said. She changed her name from Valarie to Saidiya, which is derived from the Swahili word for “to help.” The change, she wrote later, “extirpated all evidence of upstanding Negroes and their striving bastard heirs, and confirmed my place in the company of poor Black girls—Tamikas, Roqueshas, and Shanequas.” (Her family called her by the new name reluctantly.)",

Jemisin has said in the past that “it’s pretty obvious that I’m drawing on the human history of structural oppression, as well as my feelings about this moment in American history”. It won Jemisin astonishing plaudits, as well as a deal for a television series.

Thompson’s courage to sound off on rape culture was radical and revolutionary for her time. For centuries, not even white women were protected by rape laws. Only their husbands or male relatives could report the rape and demand compensation as victims of “property damage.” Imagine what it must have been like to have the perpetrator be your father or husband? On paper, marital rape didn’t become illegal in the United States until 1976. Black women in the 1800s certainly weren’t positioned to charge white men with rape as they were considered chattel, and their masters were permitted under the law to do as they pleased. Not only was Thompson, a disabled Black trans woman, one of the first Black people in American history to testify before Congress, she was also one of the first women and the first trans person to do so.",

She produced and created such protest songs as “Mississippi Goddam,” “Old Jim Crow,” “Why (The King of Love is Dead),” and “Young, Gifted and Black.” The latter two songs were dedicated to her friends, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Lorraine Hansberry, whose lives were tragically cut short.\nAfter lackluster sales of subsequent albums and cold reception from her record company, Simone believed she was being punished for her activism. Simone left Stroud and the U.S. in 1970, and sought refuge in various locations around the world including in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. She lived abroad for several years, finally returning to the U.S. in 1995 to reclaim music royalties owed to her after the release of her music without her permission.

History and experiences, emotion and knowledge travel across time and back again, linking the artist and viewers of her work with generations of people who came before them. This is made explicit in her commitment to certain themes, imagery, and objects, and her continual reinvention of them over decades. “I can no longer separate the work by saying this deals with the occult and this deals with shamanism or this deals with so and so…. It’s all together and it’s just my work,” she said in 1989. The artist has also repeatedly turned to her family and their history as sources for her work. “Keep for Old Memiors” (1976) includes fragments of letters and photographs saved by the artist’s great aunt Hattie, framed by a pair of women’s gloves that suggest, among other things, the tactility of accessing a physical record of one’s life. The intimacy and scale of Saar’s work encourages a personal connection to the artist and her experience. “To me the trick is to seduce the viewer. If you can get the viewer to look at a work of art, then you might be able to give them some sort of message.” Over the course of her now six-decade career, Saar has continued to make work that honors or critiques the familiar and mines the unknown. “It may not be possible to convey to someone else the mysterious transforming gifts by which dreams, memory, and experience become art.

Her mother was a domestic servant.\nBy age seven, Taylor was allowed to move to Savannah, Georgia, to live with her grandmother, Dolly. Most of her childhood was spent with two of her eight siblings and with Grandmother Dolly, who encouraged Taylor to learn to read and write.\nAt this time, Georgia had severe restrictions on education for freed and enslaved African Americans. Clandestine schooling was the only way an African American child could get an education in the Antebellum South. Taylor’s grandmother arranged for her to attend two secret schools taught by free African American women and family friends. Born into slavery in the Deep South, she served the Union Army in various capacities: officially as a \"laundress\" but in reality a nurse, caretaker, educator, and friend to the First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry (later the 33rd U.S. Colored Troops Infantry Regiment). In 1902, she published these experiences in Reminiscences of My Life in Camp, a Civil War memoir told from the singular perspective of an African American woman. Her work during the Civil War certainly included washing clothes, but also extended into the realm of gun maintenance, nursing, and education—positions befitting her experience as a schoolteacher. At just 14 years of age, Taylor had become the first African American known to teach at a freedman’s school in Georgia. In a 1902 letter republished in Reminiscences (p. xiii), Colonel Trowbridge apologized for the \"technicality\" of Taylor's identification as only a laundress, rather than a nurse. Such a \"technicality\" led to her never receiving pay or a pension.\nWhile Taylor's contributions to the war are nothing short of incredible, her story is often overlooked within Civil War history.",

Tubman, who didn’t speak the region’s Gullah dialect, reportedly went on deck and sang a popular song from the abolitionist movement that calmed the group down. He wrote a story without a byline about the “She-Moses” but never mentioned Tubman’s name. He wrote that Montgomery’s “gallant band of 300 soldiers under the guidance of a Black woman, dashed into the enemies’ country, struck a bold and effective blow, destroying millions of dollars worth of commissary store, cotton and lordly dwellings, and striking terror to the heart of the rebeldom brought off bear 800 slaves and thousands of dollars worth of property, without losing a man or receiving a scratch.” Despite the mission’s success, including the recruitment of at least 100 freedmen into the Union Army, Tubman was not compensated for her efforts on the Combahee Ferry Raid. She had petitioned the government several times to be paid for her duties as a soldier. “She was denied because she was a woman,” says Larson.",

Drawing on real-world examples, she shows how TVC creates dynamic learning environments where underrepresented ethnic students feel that they belong. Students who remix computationally, for instance, have larger toolkits of computational skills with which to connect cultural practices to STEAM subjects; reappropriation offers a way to navigate cultural repertoires; improvisation is firmly rooted in cultural and creative practices. Finally, Gaskins explores an equity-oriented approach that makes a distinction between conventional or dominant pedagogical approaches and culturally relevant or responsive making methods and practices. She describes TVC habits of mind and suggests methods of instructions and projects.",

Ultimately, her confidence, swag and conviction, her commitment to taking risks and pushing the boundaries, is what I believe makes her a true style icon.”\n“Missy is so personable and warm and fuzzy and confident and shy, if that makes sense?” said Ambrose. “There’s a coyness to her. When you think about the word coy, Missy is the epitome. Clever but she still knows how to work it. Since I’ve known her, for over 22 years, she’s always been that way.”\nAmbrose points to the “Lose It” music video, as an indicator of how ahead of her time Elliott has been. “We had a lot of girls dressed like boys, which is such a relevant moment as we talk about gender-bending and being gender neutral today. She was really on the pulse of that early, showing that girls can be in tank tops.”\nAmbrose believes that’s part of why Elliott’s style changed hip-hop. “We were all about body image,” she says. “No matter what size you are, you can say confidently, ‘This is who I am.’ No matter what shape or size, color or gender, it doesn’t matter.”",

      "bio": "Each of the many campaigns Gilmore worked on over the years was built from a different coalition of people who could be negatively affected by a new jail or prison. Her strategy was not to simply fight prisons directly and hope others joined in but rather to seek out groups that were already mobilized. Whether environmentalists who could be made to realize that a new prison would harm biodiversity, or local community members worried about a prison’s impact on the water table or undeliverable promises of local employment, “whatever is already there, in terms of people who are organized, that is how to direct the work,” Gilmore told me. “You have to talk to people and see what they want.” In 2004, for example, there was a measure on the Los Angeles County ballot to hire 5,000 new police officers and deputy sheriffs and to start expanding the city’s jail. Gilmore helped organize a campaign in South Central and East Los Angeles, meeting and talking to people, getting them to ask questions and to express their needs. Did the needs of neighborhood residents coincide with the needs of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s and Police Departments? Did they want more police officers in their communities? The answer was no. The measure failed. “It was plodding work — organizing, and organizing, and organizing — but we won. We beat them back.” She got her way and has been developing the concept of carceral geography ever since, a category of scholarship she more or less single-handedly invented, which examines the complex interrelationships among landscape, natural resources, political economy, infrastructure and the policing, jailing, caging and controlling of populations. In the years since, Gilmore has shaped the thinking of many geographers, as well as generations of graduate students and activists.",

Cleveland and Franklin excite one another, and soon they sound like duelling Howlin’ Wolves. She closes her eyes and seems happy. In a way, the exercise—filling gospel to the gills with blues sensibility—is a callback to Dorsey, who helped, through “Precious Lord” and many other compositions, to bring the secular sound into the church and start the motion that would culminate, amazingly, in Aretha. Similarly, on the second night, toward the end of the film, she strolls over to the piano—she’s got a mean tomtom of a left hand that gives her playing a jutting edge—and plays “Never Grow Old.” She’s not too far from where her father, the famous preacher C. L. Franklin, sits, flanked by friends. “Never Grow Old” is an old song, but Aretha claims it, making her elders trade expressions of devotion, glee, and terror at her talent, and dismay at the passage of time.

In 1944, she graduated as the valedictorian of her Howard University law class, producing a senior thesis titled “Should the Civil Rights Cases and Plessy Be Overruled?” Trained by William Howard Hastie and Leon Ransom at Howard, Pauli Murray had been witness to their early legal strategy of combating separate but equal doctrine by forcing states to either make black institutions equal to their white counterparts or integrate white institutions, if they failed to do so. However, she argued that Plessy v. Ferguson was inherently immoral and discriminatory and should be overturned. When she brought up this argument to her classmates, she noted that her suggestion was received with “hoots of derisive laughter.” Murray coined the term “Jane Crow” to name the forms of sexist derision she frequently encountered during her time at Howard. It was the piece she co-authored in 1965 called “Jane Crow and the Law” that Ginsburg cites as so influential in her thinking about legal remedies for sex discrimination. Nearly 10 years later, in 1953, Spottswood Robinson, Thurgood Marshall and others pulled out a copy of her senior paper and used it as a guide to strategize how they would argue the Brown v. Board case. They didn’t bother to mention this until about 10 years later, when she ran into Robinson at Howard Law School. It is incredibly important to situate Murray within these lesser-known genealogies of queer and feminist black civil rights activism. The civil rights struggle demanded respectable performances of black manhood and womanhood, particularly from its heroes and heroines, and respectability meant being educated, heterosexual, married and Christian. Murray’s open lesbian relationships and her gender nonconforming identity disrupted the dictates of respectability, making it easier to erase her five decades of important intellectual and political contributions from our broader narrative of civil rights.",

As she recalled in Mr. Berendt’s book, her mother, inspired by a wine bottle label, had intended the name for a younger sister but had had a miscarriage. Ms. Chablis immediately expressed interest in the name.\n“I said, ‘Ooooo, Chablis. That’s nice. I like that name,’ ” she was quoted as saying in the book. “And Mama said, ‘Then take it, baby. Just call yourself Chablis from now on.’ So ever since then, I’ve been Chablis.” She had her name legally changed to The Lady Chablis.",

The Shah of Iran was deposed and Ruhollah Khomeini came to power. The United States was chased out of Iran, Jimmy Carter was President, and there were hostages. I remember having met Carter, when he was campaigning years before, on the set of the still very new Saturday Night Live (it never occurred to me then that this show would have such a long run) because somebody I was dating was a field producer for the show. We stood in a circle and shook his hand.\n\nMy second prime—and neither time did I realize I was in my prime, or even what a prime was, or that it could end—was 9/11, when those planes hit the World Trade Center Towers and the United States went to war with Iraq and Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. I was 49. I had separated from my husband and finished my Ph.D. in 1999, and was living in our family apartment in Harlem on 145th Street on the 14th floor with an unimpeded view of the entire city, and I was sleeping around with a variety of guys, carefully chosen. Or perhaps I should say I was carefully chosen, because when you are a 49-year-old dark-skinned African American woman, have written three books (depending on how you count them), and have a Ph.D., you don’t have the choice to date just anybody. Most black men, for instance, will barely talk to you. I no longer have a preference for black men, but it doesn’t really matter what my preference is. Nobody ever asks.",

She is most often honored for her journalism exposing lynchings in the South. To me, she is what great-grandmothers are to many: a teacher. From Ida, I learned that there is no end to a fight for justice. While most famous suffragists—Alice Paul, Carrie Chapman Catt—ended their fight in 1920, Ida did not. She continued to push for Black women’s voting access for the rest of her life, and taught me lessons that I take into my fight for suffrage. I, too, am a suffragist, because in 2020 many Americans still do not have access to the vote. I grew up hearing about Ida’s willingness to speak up against injustice, inequality and indignity. About her refusal to be silenced, sidelined or marginalized. I heard about the time she wouldn’t go to the “colored car” on the Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad in 1884, and rather than leave the car, for which she had purchased a ticket, she was forced off. She promptly secured an attorney and sued the railroad. I heard about the time when, in 1892, three of her friends were lynched because they owned a grocery store that competed against a white-owned store, and she wrote about it so much in the Memphis Free Speech newspaper that her own life was threatened. She encouraged Black people to use what little power they had to protest, to boycott and ultimately to leave Memphis if they had the means to do so. She was not interested in being second in anything.",

Wright Mills Award, and garnered other awards from the Association of Women in Psychology and Black Women Historians. Collins has pushed scholars to identify the ground on which they stand, rather than claiming neutral space. Black Feminist Thought clearly identifies an intersectional analysis, rather than a hierarchical formula where race is primary over gender or where social class trumps all. Her theoretical analysis shows how oppression operates in various spheres—political, economic, and ideological. Thus, although we can appreciate that social class may offer some protection or resources to battle the sexism and racism that Black women experience, achieving middle class status does not remove one from the political, economic, and ideological operations. Most importantly, Black Feminist Thought illuminated how Black women have looked at and analyzed their lives in the past—challenging the sociological thinking that rendered them invisible, making them witnesses but not analysts of their own lives. The clarity of her discussion of power, including how oppressed people understand the power that engulfs them and develop alternative self-definitions of themselves and their situations, has turned the tide of theoretical analysis. In sharing the voices of Black women, Collins exposed many scholars to a literature and history that was new.",

Of course it was important to reflect that. I think this is a historical necessity. We talk about slavery sometimes as if black folks were just submissively accepting and enduring what happened, but that was certainly not the case and people were resisting in all kinds of ways. And I really appreciate many of the black feminist historians who I quote who talk about how black women resisted in all kinds of ways on a daily basis the violence of slavery. So I wanted similarly reflect the ways in which people are resisting in all kinds of ways the daily police violence that black women and women of color are subjected to and I wanted to illustrate how looking at this issue through the lens of women's experiences might shift the ways in which we resist, might expand the demands that we make. For instance, if we are going to make a demand about excessive force policy, we are going to make sure that it addresses excessive force against pregnant people. If we're going to make a demand about anything else, we're going to do that in a way that reflects multiple experiences of a particular problem. That we are going to evaluate our responses also through the lens of, 'is this actually going to reduce police violence against black women and women of color or is just going to shift the form that it takes?'",

      "bio": "On Saturday, January 16, 2021, activist, organizer, and scholar Naomi Simmons-Thorne led a teach-in on the “We Would Have To Fight The World: Cultural Politics of Black Feminist Critical Theory”. Black scholars have traditionally assumed race as the identity “of primary historical importance” concerning Black communities and their movements for social justice (Dawson 1994). This teach-in sought to interrogate this assumption through a survey of critical discourses spanning abolition to Black Lives Matter. While few would argue against the historical “overdetermination” of racism, Black feminist critical theory has often sought to destabilize what scholars call the “metalanguage” of race. They argue while the force of racist brutality is often overwhelming, that Black people remain equally targeted by systemic structures unaccounted by the “single-axis” of conventional anti-racist discourse and politics. Systemic failures to address oppression on multiple axes renders particular systems and their targets analytically invisible, thus stratifying the politics of Black communities on the structural lines of visibility and re-inscribing oppressions by treating counter discourses and counter movements as ancillary projects to Black liberation. This teach-in surveyed critical discourses concerning gender, sex, and sexuality, locating their relationships to black politics—historical and contemporary—and their ongoing relevancy to the construction of Black political discourse.",

I believe that this is how the world changes. It always changes as a result of the pressure that masses of people, ordinary people, exert on the existing state of affairs.

Maybe what we must demand is not liberatory designs but just plain old liberation. Too retro, perhaps? And that is part of the issue — by adding “design” to our vision of social change we rebrand it, upgrading social change from “mere” liberation to something out of the box, “disrupting” the status quo. But why? As Vinsel queries, “would Design Thinking have helped Rosa Parks ‘design’ the Montgomery Bus Boycott?” It is not simply that design thinking wrongly claims newness, but in doing so it erases the insights and agency of those who are discounted because they are not designers, capitalizing on the demand for novelty across numerous fields of action and coaxing everyone who dons the cloak of design into being seen and heard through the dominant aesthetic of innovation.

But Lewis, who placed Southern cooking in the pantheon of great cuisines, respected fried chicken as a special-­occasion food. She made hers not by punishing it in a pot of hot grease, but by patiently turning it in a shallow pan, crisping it over time in a blend of lard, butter and country ham, a technique that reflects something greater than the flavor of conjoined fats. When Lewis was growing up in Freetown, she learned that there was a season truly perfect for frying chickens — late spring to early summer, when the birds were the right size and had the right feed — just as there was a season for peaches and a season for blackberries. Foods, Lewis argued, are always temporal, so all good tastes are special. And when you have only a few chances every year to make something, you make it well. You use home-rendered lard to cook the bird. You brown the breasts first, then lay them on top of the sizzling legs so that they finish cooking gently in the heat above the pan. You slip in a slice of country ham to season the fat. That’s how you give thanks for it.",

      "bio": "Richardson was the first woman to lead a prolonged grassroots civil rights movement outside the Deep South.In 1962, she helped organize and led the Cambridge Movement on Maryland’s Eastern Shore with sit-ins to desegregate restaurants, bowling alleys and movie theaters in protests that marked an early part of the budding Black Power movement. “I say that the Cambridge Movement was the soil in which Richardson planted a seed of Black power and nurtured its growth,” said Joseph R. Fitzgerald, who wrote a 2018 biography on Richardson titled The Struggle is Eternal: Gloria Richardson and Black Liberation. She became the leader of demonstrations over bread and butter economic issues like jobs, health care access and sufficient housing. “Everything that the Black Lives Matter movement is working at right now is a continuation of what the Cambridge Movement was doing,” Fitzgerald said.",

Black Feminist Ecological Thought emphasizes the importance of recognizing this kind of novel as being both Ecological Art and Black Feminist Art simultaneously. Black Feminist Ecological Thought also illuminates the reasons why it is important for us to interweave both perspectives in order to discern the transformative potential of the text. In this case, the transformative potential being: the ecological harms of misogynoir and anti-Indigeneity affect Black women extremely intensely, and those effects also guarantee a despairing destruction for all directly responsible and/or indirectly complicit.",

      "bio": "The first wave of environmental justice literature tended to define environmental racism as the disparate siting of toxic waste facilities in low-income areas and communities of colour. More recently, environmental justice scholars have turned to a critical environmental justice framework to explore questions of spatial equity in relation to movements like Black Lives Matter. It is increasingly clear that the state, the built environment, economic development, and race converge in communities who face increased surveillance, divestment, and gentrification. Using Hyde Park on the South Side of Chicago as a case study, I draw on qualitative and historical methods to interrogate dominant narratives surrounding policing in urban environments. This paper highlights how Black geographies, as an analytic, highlight the intersection of police brutality and the built environment in Hyde Park. Legacies of urban renewal, now framed as neighbourhood revitalisation, and narratives around criminality and race all influence community police relations in the area. As the University of Chicago expands, so does its police force, and so do conflicts over who can use public spaces and how these spaces are used. I argue that institutions like the University of Chicago rely on the police to racially manage and expand their built environment. I also look to Black Lives Matter as a way to understand police brutality as enmeshed with toxic ecologies. This pairing of activism, ecology and policing allows a more nuanced analysis of the racialised underpinnings of the built environment.",

It historicizes the work of enslaved, free,and emancipated communities to create a distinctive and often furtive social architec-ture rivaling, threatening, and challenging the infrastructures of abstraction, com-modification, and social control developed by white elites before and after the formal abolition of slavery. Practices centered in the various iterations of the plot — the site of the body’s interment, the garden parcel, and hidden insurrectionary activity — fostered a vision of de-commodified water and landscapes as well as resources. Evolving indialectic with mastery and dominion — or biblically justified total control  — enslaved and post-emancipation communities claimed and created a set of communal resour-ces within the interstices of plantation ecologies, constituting the Black commons.",

      "bio": "Gilles Deleuze has written that movement is a translation in space. In this talk I use this distinction as a framework for critical reflection on engaging how past agents marginalized in history have influenced the meaning of space and place. My focus will center on enslaved people who liberated themselves from bondage in the Great Dismal Swamp borderlands area of Virginia and North Carolina. Throughout this talk I will discuss how geospatial analysis has broadened the ways I approach enslaved movement in cartographies of struggle by pointing out the literal and figurative connections to space that enslaved people recognized in their journeys toward making freedom. The human costs associated with running away like distance, navigational literacy, and access to shelter and food are all weighed in this conversation. Ultimately the goal of this talk is to expand our understanding of how geospatial processes intervene with investigations into slavery and freedom and inform how enslaved movement translates spaces of the past.",

She was not always a hermit at the beach. She was raised in one of the preeminent black families in the South and was educated at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio. She studied voice in Paris and London, and sang opera throughout Germany during the mid- 1950s and early ’60s in concert halls where she is still remembered four decades after she quit her glamorous career because she felt herself called home to Florida. She jettisoned more than her diva status. She also gave away her significant inheritance, writing checks to conservation causes until the money ran out in the late 1970s, with the intangible compensation that a textbook on butterflies is dedicated to her and an Atlantic-traveling whale has been given her name (MaVynee #1151) by biologists at Boston’s New England Aquarium. If MaVynee does indeed decide to float off as a butterfly, she certainly won’t lack for credentials.",

It’s heartbreaking to think the difference its survival might have made.”\nRecently, in the context of questions over Confederate monuments, there have been calls to recreate Savage’s “The Harp” and display it at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.\nSavage viewed her own legacy with humility, putting the emphasis on the success of her students. In a 1935 interview in Metropolitan Magazine, she said, “I have created nothing really beautiful, really lasting, but if I can inspire one of these youngsters to develop the talent I know they possess, then my monument will be in their work.”",
